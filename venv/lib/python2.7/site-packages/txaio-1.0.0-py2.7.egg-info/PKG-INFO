Description: 
        ``txaio`` is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified on
        both Twisted and asyncio.
        
        This is like `six <http://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_, but for wrapping
        over differences between Twisted and asyncio so one can write code
        that runs unmodified on both (*aka* "source code compatibility"). In
        other words: your users can choose if they want asyncio **or** Twisted
        as a dependency.
        
            Note that, with this approach, user code runs under the native
            event loop of either Twisted or asyncio. This is different from
            attaching either one's event loop to the other using some event
            loop adapter.
